        'Starting its journey in 1975, Al-Hassan Diamond Gallery Ltd. (formerly Al-Hassan Jewellers Ltd.) is one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the jewellery sector in Dhaka city. Beginning its journey from the busy New Market and Chandni Chawk, we then moved to up-scale Banani and finally to pristine Gulshan-1 & Jamuna Future Park. We currently have two showrooms; our flagship store is in Gulshan-1 with over 5000 sq/ft. housing some of the finest Diamond & Gold Jewellery collections in the city. We also have an equally impressive showroom in Jamuna Future Park. We believe in delivering quality to our customers, and see ourselves as a large diamond boutique. We only sell ‘Ethically Sourced’ ‘Natural Diamond’ jewellery, all of which are tested, rated, and certified by International Gemology Institute (IGI). All of our products are registered online and come with an IGI certificate. As a diamond boutique, we believe in providing service along with the product, which includes but isn’t limited to lifetime cleaning, repair services, and exchange services (deduction of 10% for exchange with a product and 20% for exchange with cash). We also provide custom orders, design development from sample/photo, laser engraving, and any other special services on request. We believe in building relationships and not just a customer-base, please do visit us for a coffee and a browse around our showroom. You are always welcome at Al-Hassan.'
